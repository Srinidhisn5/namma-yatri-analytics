## Project Overview
Comprehensive data analysis dashboard for urban mobility optimization, focused on Bangalore's ride-hailing ecosystem. This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics capabilities from SQL querying to interactive visualization.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Metrics Tracking:** Daily rides, active drivers, earnings, trip duration
- **Demand Pattern Analysis:** Peak hours identification and route optimization
- **Driver Performance Analytics:** Retention strategies and earnings insights
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Chart.js powered dynamic charts

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL:** Complex queries for data extraction and analysis (PostgreSQL)
- **Python:** Data processing with Pandas and NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards with Chart.js
- **Business Intelligence:** Actionable insights from data patterns

## Key Insights Generated
1. **68% of rides occur during 8-10 AM and 6-8 PM** - Dynamic driver allocation opportunity
2. **22% routing inefficiency on key routes** - ML optimization potential
3. **7.2% cancellation rate** in specific zones - Algorithm improvement scope
4. **15+ rides/day drivers have 85% retention** - Gamification strategy
